I set up this site to act as both a development blog
and a source of tutorials, and documentation for all
of the eo.rs projects.

The main focus at the moment is getting [reoserv](https://github.com/sorokya/reoserv)
up to feature parity with the [eoserv](https://eoserv.net/) project.

I'm also developing up the [eo](https://github.com/sorokya/eo) create as I go!

I have a few ideas for blogs already from the [reoserv](https://github.com/sorokya/reoserv)
project. Stay tuned!
